# OUTDATED!!!
This plugin is no longer compatible with newer game version and DOES NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE OFFICIAL PLUGINS.

I will not updating this repo for newer games.

You should be using [@duel0213/asphyxia-plugins/staging](https://github.com/duel0213/asphyxia-plugins/tree/staging) instead. This one is more inline compatible with the official Asphyxia plugin than @patapancakes (which is what this fork based on).

Score will not be transferrable over to @duel0213's plugin. You will be starting over. We will not help you with this.
